# 10.1 Builds

_Last Updated_: 6/27/2023 - Adjust builds from hotfixes with more options for Dark Ascension and Distorted Reality.

# Single Target
Void Eruption and Dark Ascension builds can be within marginal DPS of one another. Voidform is a solid default to use, but Dark Ascension can shine if you are looking for more damage every other minute in between Power Infusions. Dark Ascension is particularly nice for fights that would end around 3:30 or 5:30 awkward timings for Voidform.

## Void Eruption

# Dungeon Builds
With our dungeon builds you generally have 4-5 flex points that you can spend on a variety of options depending on if you want more single target, aoe, or overall damage. The builds below pick the mix of flex points that generically perform the best across a variety of keys, but feel free to experiment with these.

## Flex Points
- Maddening Touch - Overall
- Dark Evangelism - Overall
- Mind Devourer - Mixed (good with Distorted Reality)
- Phantasmal Pathogen - Single Target
- Mental Decay - Single Target
- Mental Fortitude - Defensive

## Build Options
In addition to Flex points you can also choose to run Distorted Reality (DR) or Mind's Eye (ME). DR builds offer 2-4% more overall damage compared to ME builds, but lose about 1% single target damage on average. Pick whichever feels more comfortable for you or how you want to build.

Note that with Distorted Reality you should _spread_ Devouring Plague on AoE to targets that will live for at least a few seconds. You should still be hitting targets with Devouring Plague but by
spreading it you can increase overall damage.

## Single Target Breakdown
This chart is showing how much single target DPS you can perform with the various builds. This is intended to help make the decision of sacrificing single target for overall easier.

## N'Zoth + Yogg-Saron + C'Thun
Generic dungeon build well suited for any key/affix

[VF_nzoth_yogg_cthun_136765509187535_Spike_DR_TS)](https://www.wowhead.com/talent-calc/priest/shadow/DAREEAFUEERUVEKFSKEQCFQNVRFURVEKQUKEVBU)
```
BIQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAESiIBAAAAAAAAAAAAIoJRSSDSSSSkIINSSSkGBJIki0CJBQSA
```

### Notes
- Can run with Distorted Reality (DR) or Mind's Eye (ME)
- Can run with Dark Ascension or Voidform
- Can utilize Flex Points to tailor your build

## N'Zoth + C'Thun
Decent AoE build that does not rely on Yogg-Saron lining up well to do good AoE or Shadowy Apparitions

```

```

### Notes
- Can run with Distorted Reality (DR) or Mind's Eye (ME)
- Generally only used with Dark Ascension
- Can utilize Flex Points to tailor your build

## Y'Shaarj + N'Zoth + C'Thun
This is a new build we are still testing with that might be better than it is currently simming for. Treat this as an experimental build and not something you should run unless you are confident in what you are doing.

### Notes
- Generally only used with Dark Ascension and Distorted Reality (DR)
- Mastermind seems to do better on single target than Screams of the Void
